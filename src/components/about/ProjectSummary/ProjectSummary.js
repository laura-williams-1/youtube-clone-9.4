        Juan, Leliah and Laura worked on a project to create a clone of the
        YouTube website. We were given a set of requirements and specifications
        to follow in order to create the clone, including building a responsive
        user interface, incorporating functionality for searching and playing
        videos, and utilizing a backend server to store and retrieve data.
        <br />
        To complete the project, we used a variety of tools and technologies,
        such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. We also used other libraries
        and frameworks to help streamline the development process and ensure the
        final product met all of the necessary requirements. Overall, the
        project was a challenging but rewarding experience that allowed us to
        build our skills as software developers and work together as a team to
        achieve a common goal. We hope you enjoy!
